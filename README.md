# HeroesBackend
A Backend for my HeroesApp

To get in touch with an Angular and Node.js, I decided to start with one of the tutorials on angular.io. I continuosly did more athan the tutorial intended and took my first angular project to a state where it required a backend.

Thats why I started this repo. Its my first take on developing a backend with Node.js
I am using express and passport in a typescript environment to provide the endpoints my HeroesApp needs.
